## üßæ Arguments & Options (copy-friendly)

Use flags with the format `-flag:value` (no spaces around the colon).
Below are the supported arguments, a short description, and ready-to-copy examples.

| Flag             | Type   | Description                                                 |                                                      |
| ---------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `-start:<int>`   | int    | Resume scan from a specific wordlist index.                 |                                                      |
| `-code:<int>`    | int    | Show this HTTP status code in results (in addition to 200). |                                                      |

| `-nex:<str>`     | string | Replace shown extension with this one (e.g. `jsp`).         |                                                      |
| `-w:<path>`      | path   | Path to a custom wordlist file.                             |                                                      |

| `-exc:<int>`     | int    | Exclude this HTTP status code from display.                 |                                                      |
| `-t:<float>`     | float  | Delay (seconds) between requests. Default `0`.              |                                                      |

### Quick copyable examples (one-line each)

Resume at index 400, include 403 responses, and skip logging:

```bash
python dirsearch.py http://example.com/ -start:400 -code:403 -ext:.js,.php,.json -exclude:html -no
```

Use a custom wordlist, replace extension shown as `jsp`, and add a 2.5s delay:

```bash
python dirsearch.py http://example.com/ -w:./wordlists/my.txt -ext:php -nex:jsp -t:2.5 -all -no
```

Scan using the built-in API wordlist and include only words containing `admin`:

```bash
python dirsearch.py http://example.com/ -api -find:admin
```

Exclude 500 responses and do not log:

```bash
python dirsearch.py http://example.com/ -exc:500 -no
```

---

### Full template (copy & paste and change values)

```bash
python dirsearch.py <TARGET_URL> -start:0 -code:403 -ext:.php,.js -nex:jsp -w:./wordlists/words.txt -exclude:html -exc:500 -t:0.5 -find:api -nofind:test -all -no -api
```

> Tip: If you only want a subset of flags, remove the rest. Example minimal usage:

```bash
python dirsearch.py http://example.com/ -ext:.php -w:./wordlists/small.txt -t:1.0
```

---

### Notes & aliases

* Flags that are "boolean" (no value) are listed as `-all`, `-no`, and `-api`. Do not add `:true` or `:1` ‚Äî just include the flag.
* Use sensible `-t` values (e.g., `0.5`, `1`, `2.5`) to avoid overloading targets.

---

## Logging

* If logging is enabled (no `-no` flag), results are written to a log file (check `dirsearch.py` for the exact path and filename).
* Add `.log` or the log filename to `.gitignore` before pushing to GitHub.

---

## Security Best Practices

* Always obtain **written permission** before testing any target.
* Use a reasonable request delay (`-t`) to avoid overloading servers.
* Set a clear custom **User-Agent** string to help identify authorized testing activity.
